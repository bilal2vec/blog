Hi! I'm currently an intern at [`Cohere`](https://cohere.ai) working on efficient and scalable large-scale distributed model-parallel training frameworks for TPUs in TensorFlow.

I study software engineering at the University of Waterloo.

I'm looking for internships for `Winter 2022` and beyond. I'm interested in backend/infra, ml research, and extremely large language models. [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qeVLS9qEd8UYpZQxqqw_MUfPCMFDENV4/view)
